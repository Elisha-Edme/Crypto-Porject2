# Crypto-Project2
Purpose: 

This is a web app that creates a quiz about homophonic encryption schemes. The user selects the propeties they want their encryption scheme to have. The choices go through a decision tree, which selects the correct scheme based on how closely the scheme fits the criteria of the users. The decision tree adds to the score, i.e. closeness, everytime the user input matches criteria of a scheme, and subtracts when the criteria mismatches. The top 3 scores are sorted and then displayed on the results page.
